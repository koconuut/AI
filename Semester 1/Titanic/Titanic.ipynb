    "# Question: What percent of first-class passengers were women?\n",
    "# I will be using an observational study to figure out the percent of first-class female passengers by using code to go through my titanic data set and calculate the percent.\n",
    "# The type of observational study I will be conducting is a retrospective study. Due to the fact that the Titanic sinking was an event that happened in the past and we're looking at existing data, it makes the observational study we're doing retrospective.\n",
    "# I will collect my data by looking at a census, because it contains information from an entire population, which in this case, were all the people on the Titanic. By looking through the census, I can collect the data I need by looking at all the first-class passengers who were women on the Titanic.\n",
    "# My census could have some bias in it because we're conducting a retrospective study. Back in 1912, our way of storing information wasn't as modern and easy to collect as it is today, so there could be missing data. We wouldn't know for sure though, since the event happened so long ago."
